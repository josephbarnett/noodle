# ADR 050 — Session-state service: one port, pluggable backends

**Status:** proposed.
**Related:** ADR 028 (`SessionStore` + marking detector — the state this
service hosts), ADR 044 (data-plane & cluster architecture — the
multi-replica deployment that motivates it), ADR 048 §10 ("state is
in-memory and per-process" — the accepted limitation this lifts),
ADR 049 §9.3 (cross-process state named as the open seam this ADR
fills).

---

## 1. Problem

### 1.1 The problem in domain terms

Turn and lineage reconstruction is **stateful across round trips**:
deciding whether a request continues a turn requires the stop reason
of the previous round trip in the same agent run, and attributing a
sub-agent to its parent requires remembering a spawn observed on an
earlier response. That memory lives in the proxy process. Two facts
of the deployment environment break that:

1. **Replicas.** A gateway deployment scales `noodle-gateway`
   horizontally. Round trips of one session are load-balanced across
   replicas, so the replica seeing the sub-agent's first request may
   not be the replica that saw the parent's spawning response. With
   per-process state, that sub-agent gets no lineage and the parent's
   turn boundary resets — silently wrong telemetry, not an error.
2. **Restarts.** A proxy restart (deploy, OOM, node drain) loses all
   in-flight session memory; every active session resumes as if cold.

### 1.2 Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **session state** | The per-session value the marking detector reads at request open and writes at response close: per-agent-run slots (turn id, agent-run id, last stop reason, lineage) plus the pending-children spawn stack. |
| **keyspace** | A named family of keys inside the service (e.g. `marking`, `tool_pairing`). Keyspaces isolate consumers; one backend hosts many. |
| **atomic update** | A read-modify-write applied as one unit: concurrent updates to the same key never lose each other's writes. |
| **generation** | A monotonic per-key version used for optimistic concurrency; an update conditioned on the generation it read. |
| **fail-open-cold** | The degraded mode when the backend is unreachable: the consumer behaves as if the key were absent (cold session) and the proxy keeps serving. Telemetry quality degrades; traffic never does. |
| **TTL** | Time-to-live after the last write, after which a key is evicted. Sessions end without a close signal, so eviction is the only cleanup. |

### 1.3 Invariants (hold regardless of backend)

- **I1 — No lost updates.** Two round trips of one session closing
  concurrently must both land their slot writes. (The current
  `get → mutate → put` is not transactional; with two concurrent
  closes, last-writer-wins can erase the other's slot.)
- **I2 — Read-your-session-writes.** A round trip opening after an
  earlier round trip of the same session closed must observe that
  close's write, regardless of which replica served each.
- **I3 — Traffic is never blocked on state.** Backend slowness or
  unavailability degrades to fail-open-cold within a bounded
  timeout; the proxy never stalls or errors a customer request
  because of the state service.
- **I4 — Bounded memory.** Every key has a TTL refreshed on write;
  abandoned sessions are evicted on every backend.

### 1.4 Current state inventory — what exists and what bypasses it

Four holders of cross-request state exist; only one sits behind a
port, and none satisfies I1 or I2:

| State | Holder | Scope | Needs cross-replica? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SessionState` (runs map: turn/agent-run/lineage per slot) | `MarkingStore` port (`crates/noodle-core/src/marking.rs:311-318`) → `InMemoryMarkingStore` DashMap (`crates/noodle-adapters/src/marking/in_memory_store.rs:26`), constructed at `crates/noodle-proxy/src/main.rs:136` | session, cross-RT | **yes** |
| `pending_children: Vec<ParentRunRef>` (spawn stack) | private DashMap **inside** `AnthropicMarkingDetector` (`crates/noodle-adapters/src/marking/anthropic.rs:65`) — bypasses the port | session, cross-RT (spawn → child's first request) | **yes** |
| `PendingToolUses` (`tool_use_id → request_id`, bounded FIFO) | `crates/noodle-proxy/src/pending_tool_uses.rs` — no port | session-ish, cross-RT (S11 pairing) | **yes** |
| `in_flight_stop` / `in_flight_decision` | private DashMaps inside the detector (`anthropic.rs:50,57`) | one round trip (open → close on one connection) | no — request and response of one round trip are served by one process |
| `Session { directive_injected: AtomicBool, … }` | `SessionStore` port (`crates/noodle-core/src/store.rs:7`, `get_or_init → Arc<Session>`) | session, cross-RT | yes, but the `Arc` + atomics shape is shared-memory-only (see §3.3) |

The `MarkingStore` trait is already the right *kind* of seam — ADR 028
anticipated "Redis / DynamoDB / etc. arriving later when
cross-process proxies do." What it lacks: atomic update (I1), async
operation (a remote backend cannot block the hot path behind a sync
call), TTL as part of the contract (I4), and coverage of the state
that grew up outside it (`pending_children`, `PendingToolUses`).

---

## 2. Solution

### 2.1 Shape

One service abstraction in `noodle-core`, namespaced by keyspace,
with pluggable backends selected by configuration:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Consumers["consumers (unchanged call sites)"]
      DET["AnthropicMarkingDetector\n(marking keyspace)"]
      PTU["tool-use pairing\n(tool_pairing keyspace)"]
    end

    subgraph Core["noodle-core"]
      PORT["SessionStateService port\nget / update(atomic) / touch_ttl"]
    end

    subgraph Adapters["noodle-adapters"]
      MEM["InMemorySessionStateService\n(DashMap entry-lock; default)"]
      RED["RedisSessionStateService\n(GET/WATCH-free CAS via generation;\nper-key TTL)"]
    end

    CFG["noodle.toml\n[session_store]"] -.selects.-> Adapters
    DET --> PORT
    PTU --> PORT
    PORT --> MEM
    PORT --> RED
    RED --> REDIS[("Redis")]
```

The port (signatures normative, names illustrative):

```rust
/// noodle-core. Async because remote backends exist; the in-memory
/// impl resolves immediately.
#[async_trait]
pub trait SessionStateService: Send + Sync + 'static {
    /// Read the current value (None = cold key).
    async fn get(&self, ks: Keyspace, key: &str) -> StateResult<Option<VersionedValue>>;

    /// Atomic read-modify-write: load, apply `f`, store — as one
    /// unit (I1). `f` may run more than once (CAS retry); it must be
    /// pure over its input. Returns the value written.
    async fn update(
        &self,
        ks: Keyspace,
        key: &str,
        f: &(dyn Fn(Option<Value>) -> Value + Send + Sync),
    ) -> StateResult<Value>;
}

/// Value = schema-versioned bytes; serialization is the consumer's
/// concern (serde), opacity is the service's (it stores bytes).
pub struct VersionedValue { pub bytes: Bytes, pub generation: u64 }
```

`StateResult` carries one error family; **every consumer maps every
error to fail-open-cold** (I3). There is no retry-until-success path
on the hot path.

### 2.2 Problem → solution mapping

| Problem concept | Owned by | Representation |
|---|---|---|
| session state (marking) | `marking` keyspace | `SessionState` (gains `pending_children`, serde + `schema_version`) |
| spawn stack | folded **into** `SessionState` | `SessionState.pending_children: Vec<ParentRunRef>` — rides the same atomic value, so spawn-push and child-pop are serialized with slot updates |
| tool-use pairing | `tool_pairing` keyspace | existing `tool_use_id → request_id` entries, TTL'd |
| atomic update (I1, I2) | the port's `update` | backend-native: DashMap entry lock in memory; generation-CAS loop on Redis |
| eviction (I4) | the port contract | TTL refreshed on every `update`; Redis `PEXPIRE`, in-memory sweep (existing `evict_older_than`, `in_memory_store.rs:53`) |
| degraded mode (I3) | consumers, uniformly | fail-open-cold + one audit event per transition (rate-limited), counter metric |
| per-flow scratch (`in_flight_*`) | **stays process-local** | unchanged — one round trip never crosses replicas |

Two deliberate exclusions:

- **`Session`/`SessionStore` (`store.rs:7`) is not migrated.** Its
  `Arc<Session>` + `AtomicBool` shape is shared-memory semantics that
  cannot be remoted; its main consumer (`directive_injected`, the
  OpenAI-path injector gate) is due for redesign under ADR 048 item 5
  anyway. The port can host it later as a third keyspace once its
  consumer has value semantics. Migrating it now couples this ADR to
  an injector redesign.
- **Brain/embellish state is out of scope** — it lives downstream of
  `tap.jsonl`, off the hot path, with its own durability story
  (SQLite).

### 2.3 Backend implementations

**In-memory (default).** Wraps a `DashMap<(Keyspace, SmolStr),
VersionedValue>`; `update` holds the entry lock across `f` — I1 by
mutual exclusion, zero new dependencies, identical performance
profile to today. Single-process deployments see no behavioral
change except the I1 fix.

**Redis.** One logical key per `(keyspace, session)`:
`noodle:{ks}:{key}` → `bytes` + `generation` (a Redis hash with
`gen` and `val` fields). `update` runs a bounded CAS loop (§4). TTL
via `PEXPIRE` on every write. Values are `postcard`-serialized
`SessionState` prefixed with a `schema_version` byte — unknown
versions are treated as cold (fail-open on schema skew during
rolling deploys).

**Why CAS-by-generation rather than the alternatives:**

- *Server-side merge (Lua)* is rejected because the merge logic is
  the marking state machine itself; duplicating it in Lua creates a
  second implementation that drifts.
- *Sticky session routing* (pin a session to a replica at the LB) is
  rejected as the primary mechanism because it requires L7 affinity
  on a custom header in every deployment environment and still loses
  state on restart. It remains a useful latency optimization on top
  of this design, never a substitute.
- *Single-writer actor per session* is in-process only; it cannot
  satisfy I2 across replicas.

### 2.4 Configuration

`[session_store]` section in `~/.noodle/noodle.toml` (same file,
sectional convention per ADR 048 §8):

```toml
[session_store]
backend = "memory"        # "memory" (default) | "valkey" ("redis" alias)
ttl_seconds = 14400       # I4 — refreshed on write
# Remote-backend only (RESP engine — see §2.5):
url = "redis://noodle-valkey:6379"
op_timeout_ms = 50        # I3 — per-operation budget before fail-open-cold
cas_max_retries = 4       # §4 — then fail-open (write skipped, audited)
```

Absent section ⇒ in-memory with the defaults above. Fail-fast
validation at startup (unreachable backend at boot is a startup error
under a remote backend, not a silent fallback — operators choose
the degraded posture explicitly, they don't discover it).

---

## 2.5 Backend engine and client selection

The remote backend targets the **RESP wire protocol**, not a specific
product. Every candidate below speaks RESP, so the adapter is written
once and the engine is an operational choice. This decoupling matters
because the engine landscape moved under the project's feet (Redis
relicensed in 2024) and will keep moving.

**The workload makes raw throughput irrelevant.** Session state is
read once at request open and written once at response close — two
ops per proxy round trip, and a proxy round trip is gated on a
multi-second model response. Even a busy gateway issues low
hundreds of state ops/sec, with values in the low-KB range. The
high-throughput engines win benchmarks at millions of ops/sec on
many cores; none of that headroom is reachable here. **The decision
is therefore driven by licensing, HA/operational story, and Rust
client fit — not by benchmark throughput.** Recorded so a future
reader doesn't "upgrade" the engine chasing a number that never
bound us.

### Engine: Valkey (reference), any RESP engine accepted

| Engine | License | Fit for noodle |
|---|---|---|
| **Valkey** *(chosen)* | BSD-3-Clause (Linux Foundation; AWS/Google/Oracle) | Drop-in RESP, permissive license, managed on every major cloud, Valkey 8 added multithreaded I/O. No copyleft friction when co-deployed with the proxy. |
| Redis 8+ | AGPLv3 / RSALv2 / SSPLv1 | Functionally fine, but AGPL is copyleft with a network-use clause — undesirable for a cache co-deployed beside a product customers ship. RSALv2/SSPL are not OSI-open. |
| DragonflyDB | BSL 1.1 (source-available) | ~4.5× single-node throughput via shared-nothing threads — irrelevant to our op rate. Source-available, not OSI-open. Keep as a drop-in option for an operator who already runs it. |
| Garnet (Microsoft) | MIT | Strong scaling, RESP-compatible, but C#/.NET runtime — a foreign dependency in a Rust shop for no workload benefit. |

**Why Valkey over staying on "Redis":** the license. noodle is a
proxy customers deploy in their own clusters; co-deploying an
AGPL-licensed cache invites a legal review every customer would
rather skip. Valkey's BSD-3 removes that conversation, performance is
identical (it forked from Redis 7.2.4), and it is the default
"Redis-compatible" engine on AWS ElastiCache/MemoryDB, GCP
Memorystore, and Azure. The config value is `backend = "valkey"`
(`"redis"` accepted as an alias; both drive the same RESP adapter).

### Client: `fred`

| Client | Why / why not |
|---|---|
| **`fred`** *(chosen)* | Markets itself as the async client "for **Valkey and Redis**"; RESP2/RESP3; centralized, sentinel, and cluster topologies; **built-in reconnection, backoff, and per-command timeout policies** — a direct fit for I3 (`op_timeout_ms` → fail-open-cold) without hand-rolling pool/timeout layers. Supports `EVAL`/`EVALSHA` for the §4 CAS Lua. |
| `redis-rs` (`redis`) | Mature, RESP3, cluster merged in — but pooling (deadpool/bb8) and timeout/reconnect policy are bolted on, which is exactly the I3 machinery `fred` gives natively. The conservative fallback if `fred` proves unsuitable. |
| `rustis` | Capable, smaller community; no reason to prefer it over `fred` here. |

### Service guarantees (HA)

- **Self-hosted (default k8s deploy):** one Valkey primary + one
  replica with **Sentinel** for automatic failover. Cluster-mode
  sharding is unnecessary — a single session keyspace of TTL'd
  low-KB values fits one node with room to spare; sharding adds
  operational surface for capacity we don't need.
- **Managed (cloud deploys):** **ElastiCache for Valkey, Serverless**
  — multi-AZ, automatic failover, 99.99% SLA, autoscaling, Valkey 8.
  **MemoryDB is not required:** its durable multi-AZ transaction log
  buys data-loss-free failover, but fail-open-cold (I3) already
  tolerates total state loss as a quality degradation, so the cheaper
  ElastiCache tier is the right default.

### Landscape basis (as of 2026-06)

Redis relicensed away from OSI-open in March 2024 (RSALv2/SSPLv1),
then re-added AGPLv3 in Redis 8 (May 2025); AGPL remains copyleft.
Valkey forked from Redis 7.2.4 under BSD-3 with Linux Foundation
governance and broad cloud backing. Throughput ranking on many-core
hardware is Dragonfly > Garnet ≈ Valkey/Redis for write-heavy
high-concurrency loads — a regime noodle's two-ops-per-model-turn
workload never enters. Sources:

## 3. Key flows

### 3.1 Round trip across two replicas (the motivating case)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CC as Agent
    participant R1 as gateway replica 1
    participant R2 as gateway replica 2
    participant SS as SessionStateService (redis)

    Note over CC,SS: parent's spawning round trip lands on replica 1
    CC->>R1: POST /v1/messages (parent)
    R1->>SS: get(marking, sid)
    SS-->>R1: SessionState{runs[A], gen=7}
    R1->>CC: …response: tool_use(Task, toolu_X)…
    R1->>SS: update(marking, sid, close+push ParentRunRef)
    SS-->>R1: ok gen=8

    Note over CC,SS: sub-agent's first request lands on replica 2
    CC->>R2: POST /v1/messages (sub-agent, unseen hash B)
    R2->>SS: get(marking, sid)
    SS-->>R2: SessionState{runs[A], pending=[toolu_X], gen=8}
    Note over R2: NewAgentRun → pop toolu_X → lineage stamped
    R2->>SS: update(marking, sid, write runs[B] + popped stack)
    SS-->>R2: ok gen=9
```

With per-process state, replica 2 sees nothing at step `get` and the
sub-agent loses lineage. With the service, the decision is identical
to the single-process case.

### 3.2 Failure flow — backend unavailable (I3)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CC as Agent
    participant GW as gateway
    participant SS as SessionStateService (redis)

    CC->>GW: POST /v1/messages
    GW->>SS: get(marking, sid) [op_timeout_ms budget]
    SS--xGW: timeout / connection refused
    Note over GW: fail-open-cold: decide as FreshSession,<br/>emit degradation audit (once per transition), count metric
    GW->>CC: round trip proceeds normally — marks present,<br/>turn/lineage may be fresh-minted (quality loss, not outage)
    Note over GW: response close: update() also fails → write skipped, audited
```

The degraded output is exactly what a proxy restart already produces
under the accepted ADR 048 §10 posture — the service makes that mode
rarer, not the failure mode worse.

---

## 4. Critical algorithm — atomic update via generation CAS

**Contract.** Inputs: keyspace, key, pure closure
`f(Option<Value>) -> Value`. Output: the stored value, or a typed
error. Preserves I1 (no lost updates) and I2 (a successful update is
visible to every subsequent `get` on any replica). `f` may execute
multiple times and must not side-effect.

**Pseudocode (Redis backend):**

```text
update(ks, key, f):
  for attempt in 0..cas_max_retries:
    (val, gen) = GET noodle:{ks}:{key}            # absent → (None, 0)
    new = f(deserialize(val))                      # local, pure
    ok = atomically:                               # single Lua call:
           if current_gen == gen:                  #   compare …
             SET val=serialize(new), gen=gen+1     #   … and swap
             PEXPIRE ttl                           #   refresh TTL (I4)
             return true
           else return false
    if ok: return new
    backoff(jitter, attempt)                       # contention is rare:
                                                   # ≤ a few concurrent RTs
                                                   # per session
  emit audit(cas_exhausted); return Err(Contended) # consumer → fail-open
```

The compare-and-swap step is the only Lua on the backend — a
five-line guard, not business logic. The in-memory backend implements
the same contract with the DashMap entry lock (no retry loop needed).

**Complexity.** Two backend round trips per proxy round trip (one
`get` at request open, one `update` at response close); CAS retries
add round trips only under same-session write contention, which is
bounded by the agent's own concurrency (Claude Code today: parent +
occasionally one sub-agent ⇒ contention windows are rare and short).
State size: `SessionState` with a handful of agent-run slots
serializes to low single-digit KB.

**Edge cases.**

- *Empty/absent key*: `f(None)` is the FreshSession path — identical
  code as cold cache; no special case.
- *Schema skew during rolling deploy*: unknown `schema_version` ⇒
  treat as `None` (fail-open-cold for that session), never a parse
  error surfacing to traffic.
- *CAS exhaustion*: skip the write, audit. The next round trip
  re-derives from whatever state won — the same self-healing the
  turn-boundary rules already exhibit after a restart.
- *Clock*: TTL uses backend-local time only; no cross-replica clock
  comparison anywhere (generations order writes, not timestamps).
- *Two replicas pop the same spawn concurrently*: impossible by
  construction once `pending_children` lives inside the CAS'd value —
  one pop wins the generation race, the other retries against the
  popped state.

**Latency budget.** Not yet measured; expected range for on-cluster
Redis is sub-millisecond per op against multi-second model round
trips, but per the project's measurement discipline this ships with a
bench (criterion harness on the port; e2e p95 delta on the gateway)
before the Redis backend is defaulted anywhere. The in-memory default
keeps the no-Redis path at today's cost.

---

## 5. Risks and accepted constraints

| Risk | Posture |
|---|---|
| Redis becomes a hot-path dependency | It does not become a *traffic* dependency: I3 caps every op with `op_timeout_ms` and degrades to cold-state semantics. The dependency is on telemetry quality only. |
| Serialization drift between replicas mid-deploy | `schema_version` byte; unknown ⇒ cold. Additive field evolution via serde defaults. |
| CAS livelock under pathological contention | Bounded retries + jitter + audited fail-open. Contention is per-session and agent-bounded. |
| In-memory ↔ Redis behavioral divergence | One conformance test suite runs against both backends through the port (same crate-level tests, parameterized) — the in-memory impl is the executable spec. |
| Detector-internal `in_flight_*` maps left local | Correct by scoping: one round trip is one connection on one replica. Documented here so it isn't "discovered" later. |

---

## 6. Implementation plan

0. **Serde + schema version on `SessionState`** (and `ParentRunRef`)
   — pure derive work, no behavior change; fold `pending_children`
   into `SessionState`.
1. **Port + in-memory backend.** `SessionStateService` in
   `noodle-core`; in-memory impl; migrate the detector from
   `MarkingStore::get/put` + private stack to `get`/`update`. The
   existing `MarkingStore` trait is retired with its call sites in
   the same change (two-port coexistence is churn with no payoff).
   Conformance suite lands here. **Fixes I1 even single-process.**
2. **Config section** `[session_store]` + startup validation +
   selection wiring in `main.rs`.
3. **Redis backend** behind a feature flag; conformance suite green
   against a real Redis (compose/testcontainer in CI e2e lane);
   latency bench (§4) recorded in `docs/operations/`.
4. **Cluster validation** on rancher-desktop: 2-replica
   `noodle-gateway` + Redis, the §3.1 capture replayed across
   replicas, lineage asserted end-to-end; kill-Redis drill asserting
   the §3.2 degradation (traffic unaffected, audit emitted).
5. *(deferred)* `tool_pairing` keyspace migration of
   `PendingToolUses`; `Session`/`directive_injected` keyspace after
   ADR 048 item 5 gives it value semantics.
